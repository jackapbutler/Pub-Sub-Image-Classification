# Model Training

There is a web application called `app.py` which is written using [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/). This app handles all of the CNN model training and inference for this small scale assignment. I have used a basic CNN model defined inside of [model_training.py](../model_training.py). You can definitely improve performance by experiment with this configuration.

To start the app run: `streamlit run app.py`.

Choose the `Model Training` option from the **What do you want to do?** select box.

Follow the instructions to train a new CNN model on the extracted image data.
