# Model Inference

Now that we have a trained model and stream processing service setup we can try to predict the label of an image.

1. Open up the `streamlit` application by running `streamlit run app.py`.

2. Choose the `Inference` option option from the **What do you want to do?** select box.

3. Choose the `model name` you want to perform the prediction.

4. Upload your chosen image to generate fashion clothing category prediction.
